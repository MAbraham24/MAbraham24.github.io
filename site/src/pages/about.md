Hello! My name is Michael Abraham. I am a junior at Allegheny College in Meadville, Pennsylvania majoring in Computer Science and English from New York, NYC. 

I was born in the Bronx in New York City, where I have lived all my life. Going to college was something that wasn’t really a choice; I had to go to college. I spent the greater part of my high school career going to a program called SEO Scholars, which set me up to go to college and prepare for the working world. The journey to where I am now has been a long, arduous one, but through it I have found the importance of education.

Education has been a journey for me, as the importance of education was something that I internalized at quite a young age. Growing up, learning has been a great interest of mine and I am grateful for all the information I take in. From reading books at a young age and seeing the development of people around me, I learned that there is always more to be learned. The lessons I’ve learned in life have been tough, but I know that I am able to persist and work harder every day.

The plan for my future is set, but I know that plans don’t always flow so smoothly. I strive to be a holistic person in order to adapt to the ever-changing future and continue developing my skills and my mind.
